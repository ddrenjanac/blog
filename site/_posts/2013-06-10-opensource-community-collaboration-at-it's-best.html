Today I had a great experience with contributing to an opensource project <a href="https://github.com/craigwblake/redline">redline</a> (Redline is a pure Java library for manipulating RPM Package Manager packages). Actually it was last week and today I had this pleasure.<p/> Last week I fixed some lines in code and pulled a <a href="https://github.com/craigwblake/redline/pull/24">merge request</a>. The same day, just 2 hours later, it was merged.<p/> Today I asked for a release to benefit from these changes without publishing an separate inhouse version. I offered some additional refactorings to justify a release, however <a href="https://github.com/craigwblake">Craig W. Blake</a> did not discussed or requested some more changes. An new <a href="http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ca%3A%22redline%22">release</a> is already online.<p/> I really appreciate that kind of cooperation. That's why I love opensource and my company <a href="http://www.immobilienscout24.de">Immobilienscout24</a> is sharing and contributing to the opensource world.<p/> See our projects at <a href="https://github.com/ImmobilienScout24">github.com/ImmobilienScout24</a>. Feel free to use it, to contribute or just report bugs!  <p/><b>update</b><p>German version is available at <a href="http://developer.immobilienscout24.de/2013/05/opensource-zusammenarbeit-von-seiner-besten-seite/">http://developer.immobilienscout24.de/2013/05/opensource-zusammenarbeit-von-seiner-besten-seite/</a>.</p>
