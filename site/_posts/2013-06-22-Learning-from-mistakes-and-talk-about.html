I just found a video when etsy talks on <a href="http://www.softdevtube.com/">softdevtube.com</a> about <a href="http://www.softdevtube.com/2013/06/18/scaling-etsy-what-went-wrong-what-went-right/">What went right, what went wrong</a>.<p/> Alternatively you can watch the slides of that presentation.<p/><iframe src="http://de.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/9561138?rel=0" width="597" height="486" frameborder="0" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no" style="border:1px solid #CCC;border-width:1px 1px 0;margin-bottom:5px" allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen> </iframe> <div style="margin-bottom:5px"> <strong> <a href="http://de.slideshare.net/beamrider9/scaling-etsy-what-went-wrong-what-went-right" title="Scaling Etsy: What Went Wrong, What Went Right" target="_blank">Scaling Etsy: What Went Wrong, What Went Right</a> </strong> from <strong><a href="http://de.slideshare.net/beamrider9" target="_blank">Ross Snyder</a></strong> </div> <p>What makes me thinking it is worth mentioning these slides is, that I  believe in the same principles (transparency, cross functional teams, talking about mistakes, reevaluate former decisions, ... ) written in there<p/> Enjoy!
