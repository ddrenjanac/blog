<p>I could conclude there is no way out-of-the-box with ubuntu and I now use truecrypt.</p>

<p>Don't make the mistake and try hibernate/resume with <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dm-crypt" target="_blank">dm-crypt</a> with big 2TB disk. This trying costs me three full days copying data with no result :(. I repeated it successfully with truecrypt.</p>

<p>I already had <href="http://www.truecrypt.org" target="_blank">truecrypt</a> running for years ... for some sensitive private data. I'd like to try something new and failed.</p>
